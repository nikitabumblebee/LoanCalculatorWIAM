Loan calculator on Swift.

How to run application:

Clone repositoty
Select real device or simulator
Run application
You can change values for both sliders, change theme (dark/light), tap button to send application. 
If you want to get error, you can change type of id in LoanResponse from Int to String. That would be an error with incorrect decoding.

Move to test navigator tab. Click on button "play" at the LoanCalculatorWIAM.
